# Notes for the video "**Flexbox Alignment and Centering with align-content**"

## Fundamental Terms Learned
- `align-content`

## Code Learned
- `align-content: flex-start || flex-end || space-between || space-around || center`

## Tips
- `align-content` takes the same parameters as the `justify-content` property
- `align-content` takes the extra space on the cross axis and splits it up
- `flex-wrap: wrap` gives us the true width of the flex items
- `align-content: stretch` is the default
- in order for `align-content` to work, it needs some sort of wrap
