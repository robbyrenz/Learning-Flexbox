# Notes for the video "**Flexbox Alignment and Centering with align-items**"

## Fundamental Terms Learned
- `align-items`

## Code Learned
- `align-items: center || stretch || flex-start || flex-end || baseline`

## Tips
- `justify-content` aligns the group of items on the main axis
- `align-items` is concerned with the cross axis
- `align-items: center` works really well if the flex container is much larger in height than the flex items, otherwise, you would not see any difference
- by default, the `align-items` is set to `stretch`
- main takeaway is that `align-items` is on the cross-axis and needs a height to work
