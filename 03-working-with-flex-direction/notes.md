# Notes for the video "**Working with Flexbox flex-direction**"

## Fundamental Terms Learned
- flex-direction
- main axis
- cross axis

## code learned
- `flex-direction: row || column || row-reverse || column-reverse`

## Tips
- `flex-direction: row` is the default of any flex container
- the position and direction of the main and cross axises depends on the value of the `flex-direction`
- main axis and cross axis are alway perpendicular to each other
- the flex-direction is important in alignment stuff
